# Fitness Club Analysis 

The idea of the project is to analyze and understand various fitness club memberships available in Canada and/or worldwide: 

1. Choose at least three websites to crawl (e.g. Planet Fitness, GoodLife Fitness, Fit4Less, etc.); 
2. Specify the details of your search (e.g. Membership, club details, etc.); 
3. Implement required features (see Final Project Information.pdf, Instructions). 
4. Compare deals and show the best deal to the user.
